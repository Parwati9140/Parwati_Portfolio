          <p>
            My name is Parwati Maurya. I am a professional and enthusiastic programmer
            in my daily life. I am a quick learner with a self-learning attitude.
            I love to learn and explore new technologies and am passionate about 
            problem-solving. I love almost all the stacks of web application development 
            and love to make the web more open to the world. My core skill is based on 
            JavaScript and I love to do most of the things using JavaScript. I am available 
            for any kind of job opportunity that suits my skills and interests.
